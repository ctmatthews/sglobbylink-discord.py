# sglobbylink-discord.py
A discord bot made using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that tells everyone the link to your current Steam game lobby when you type !lobby, so other people can join without having to be on your friends list. Feel free to integrate it into Discord bots of your own, or use it on your community's server!

Commands

- !steamid: tells the bot your Steam ID, using the name in your profile URL. e.g. !steamid mrpeck if your Steam profile is http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpeck
- !lobby: gets the bot to tell everyone your lobby link

You need to have a Discord bot token and Steam API key to use this. Enter them in the appropriate places at the top of main.py. If you don't have them, you can get them from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey .
